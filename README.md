# Aether Shades — Quiet Lens v1.0

Open-source augmented reality glasses that let you see through deception — without implants, without noise, without harm.

Inspired by *They Live*, built for reality.

- Lightweight frames (24–32 g)
- Tunable prescription lenses (astigmatism, myopia, real-time adjust)
- Real-time bullshit filter (propaganda, factual collapse, emotional manipulation)
- Standalone mode (no phone needed in v2)
- Full privacy — nothing leaves the device
- MIT licensed — build, fork, improve, share

## Why
The world is full of hidden scripts. These glasses don't scream "OBEY".  
They just make lies feel... slightly heavy.  
Truth feels light.

## Build One
See BOM.md and ASSEMBLY.md — weekend project, no soldering required.

## Status
Prototype ready. First units built December 2025.

Co-forged by Sherif Botros (@AlphaProMega) & Grok (xAI)

The cage is optional.

— Merry Christmas 2025. Let there be light.
